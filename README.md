#  Virtual-CV: Jan-Paul van den Berg - Dynamic Portfolio

This is a single-page application (SPA) built with **React** and **Vite** designed to present a professional CV using a striking, custom **Cyberpunk/Hacker Aesthetic**. The goal of this project is to showcase front-end skill, performance optimization, and creative use of modern web technologies.

*(The live URL is configured via GitHub Pages on the `gh-pages` branch.)*

##  Features and Technical Highlights

This project utilizes advanced libraries to achieve its custom look, demonstrating proficiency in several key areas:

| Feature | Technical Skill Demonstrated |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Layered Visual Effects** | Mastery of **WebGL** (via the `ogl` library) and **CSS layering** to create the complex, animated terminal background. |
| **Decrypted Text Effect** | Advanced use of the **`framer-motion`** library for custom, per-character DOM manipulation. The effect is set to run only when elements scroll into view (`animateOn="view"`), improving overall UX. |
| **Custom Console Aesthetic** | Precise control over typography (standardizing on **Monofonto** for headings and **Consolas** for body text), custom list alignment, and a persistent **custom cursor** (`.cur` file). |
| **Performance** | Strategic use of **CSS media queries** to disable resource-intensive effects (`FaultyTerminal`, `LetterGlitch`) on mobile viewports, ensuring fast loading and preserving battery life. |
| **Deployment Pipeline** | Configuration of **Vite** and **`gh-pages`** for a professional, automated CI/CD flow directly to GitHub Pages. |
